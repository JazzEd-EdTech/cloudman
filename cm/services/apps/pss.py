        Start this service by running the 'Post Start Script'.

        Post start scripts are resolved in the following order:
        1. If a `post_start_script_url` (for master) or `worker_post_start_script_url`
        (for worker) is defined in user_data, it is processed first.
        These can be semi-colon separated lists, in which case they are executed one at a time,
        and can contain http paths, filenames or local file paths.
        E.g.:
        1. `http://domain.org/scripts/myscript.sh;/opt/app/start.d;bucket_script.sh;/opt/app/poststart.d;`
        2. 'file:///opt/app/mystartup.d;hello'

        For each url found, the following rules apply:
            a. If the url is an http url, the file is downloaded and executed
            b. If it's a filename only (no path), the cluster bucket will be first checked
            for the filename, and if it exists, downloaded and executed. Otherwise, the
            script will be assumed to be local and executed from the system path.
            c. If the path refers to a local directory, all scripts in that directory will
            be executed using the run-parts utility. (Refer to Ubuntu man pages for documentation
            on run-parts).
            d. If it's a local file, the script will be directly executed.

        2. If these URL's are not defined in the user data, falls back to legacy behaviour,
        by checking if files `post_start_script` or `worker_post_start_script`, for master
        and worker respectively, exist in the cluster bucket. If available, they are downloaded
        and executed.

        Finally, the service is marked as COMPLETED and as 'not active'.
